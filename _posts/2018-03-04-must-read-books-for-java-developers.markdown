         <b>Joshua Bloch</b> does an amazing job explaining best practices and providing detailed insights into how and when
         to use the different Java features. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134685997/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=viktarx-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0134685997&linkId=b55b7647430a5f4202d67800eb5e31bf'>Effective Java</a>
         is a must-read for every professional Java developer.
         <br/>
         It's kind of a dictionary for me, so I would recommend to have
         it in paper on your working desk.
