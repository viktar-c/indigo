There are few ways to keep your Java programming skills constantly
improving. The most popular ones of course is online web-resources with
articles, forums and blogs, question and answer online communities.
<br/>
Another one great source of teaching you new things is books. Here is
my list of books advised for all levels of Java programmers.

         <b>Joshua Bloch</b> does an amazing job explaining best practices and providing detailed insights into how and when
         to use the different Java features. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134685997/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=viktarx-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0134685997&linkId=b55b7647430a5f4202d67800eb5e31bf'>Effective Java</a>
         is a must-read for every professional Java developer.
         <br/>
         It's kind of a dictionary for me, so I would recommend to have
         it in paper on your working desk.

           For sure it's a kind of a Bible of  Object Oriented Programming.
           <br/>
           If you consider yourself not just a codder, but software
           engineer, you have to read this deep and philosophical book
           about how to turn your mind to an <b>Object Oriented</b> design,
           programming, analysis, and thinking.

        The best book explaining concurrency in Java for sure.
        It gives all the concepts you ever need to know about concurrency in general.
        From basic concurrency principles to concurrency issues that would arise
        in almost all concurrent programs, and finally to some optimization techniques.
        <br/>
        It also provides some in-sights on some of the Java concurrent utility
        classes provided by the JDK package.
